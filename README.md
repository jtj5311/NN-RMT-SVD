Abstract: In this work, we present some applications of random matrix theory for
the training of deep neural networks. Recently, random matrix theory (RMT) has
been applied to the overfitting problem in deep learning. Specifically, it has been
shown that the spectrum of the weight layers of a deep neural network (DNN) can
be studied and understood using techniques from RMT. In this work, these RMT
techniques will be used to determine which and how many singular values should
be removed from the weight layers of a DNN during training, via singular value
decomposition (SVD), so as to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy. We show
the results on a simple DNN model trained on MNIST. In general, these techniques
may be applied to any fully connected layer of a pretrained DNN to reduce the
number of parameters in the layer while preserving and sometimes increasing the
accuracy of the DNN.
